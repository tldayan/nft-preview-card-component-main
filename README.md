The NFT Preview Card Component challenge focuses on building a captivating card that showcases the details of an NFT, including its image, title, artist, and pricing. The component should have an eye-catching design and be visually appealing.

Throughout the challenge, I worked on understanding the design requirements and translating them into code. By utilizing HTML and CSS, I implemented a layout that highlights the NFT's key features and captures the essence of its uniqueness.

I paid special attention to the visual presentation of the card, ensuring that the provided image, title, artist, and pricing details are displayed prominently. The design aims to capture the attention of potential buyers and convey the value of the NFT effectively.
